{"name":"Summaryrank","tagline":"Python toolkit for ranking experiments on sentence/summary data","body":"SummaryRank\r\n===========\r\n\r\nSummaryRank is a python package dedicated to supporting ranking experiments over sentence/summary data.  It has implemented a range of basic functions, such as data imports, representations/features generation, and feature vectors split/join operations (for SVMLight format), to make ranking experiments easy.\r\n\r\nAs of January 2016, this package supports the following sets of features:\r\n\r\n* Query-biased summarization features from Metzler and Kanungo (2008) \r\n* ESA and Word2Vec features from Chen et al. (2015)\r\n* TAGME feature and context meta-features from Yang et al. (2016)\r\n\r\nIf you use this package in your research work, please cite the following paper:\r\n\r\n    Liu Yang, Qingyao Ai, Damiano Spina, Ruey-Cheng Chen, Liang Pang, W.

In Proceedings of ECIR '16, to appear. 2016.\r\n\r\nDetailed installation instructions and usage will be made available shortly.\r\n\r\n## Contributors ##\r\n\r\n* Ruey-Cheng Chen\r\n* Damiano Spina\r\n* Liu Yang\r\n* Qingyao Ai\r\n\r\n## References ##\r\n\r\n<a name=\"chen_2015_harnessing\"></a> Ruey-Cheng Chen, Damiano Spina, W.
